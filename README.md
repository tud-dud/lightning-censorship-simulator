This is a set of binaries to simulate payment delivery in the Lightning network
under various attack scenarios or analyse the network-level topology.

## Build

Compile all members of the project:

`cargo build --release`

Run all unit tests:

`cargo test --release`

## simulator

The binary reconstructs the network topology using an input graph, maps nodes to
ASNs and uses the
[lightning-simulator](https://github.com/tud-dud/lightning-simulator)
to simulate payment delivery in the network.
The tool simulates payment failure under different attack scenarios.
We provide the snapshot of the LN in the `snapshots/` directory that was used
to run our simulations.

       target/release/simulator [OPTIONS] <GRAPH_FILE> [VERBOSE]

       Arguments:
         <GRAPH_FILE>  Path to JSON ile describing topology
         [VERBOSE]

       Options:
         -l, --log <LOG_LEVEL>                [default: info]

## as_node_degree

The binary reads the channel graph and maps each to node with a public address
to its ASN.
The output is a CSV file with two columns per node -- its ASN and degree (number
of channels).

*NB: Nodes with only a Tor address are assigned ASN 0.*

        Options:

  </details>

## intra_as_channels

The binary reads the channel graph, maps each to node with a public address
to its ASN and counts the number of channels the node has to other nodes in its
ASN.
The output is a CSV file with three columns per AS -- its ASN, the total number
of intra-AS channels and the total number of inter-AS channels.

*NB: Nodes with only a Tor address are assigned ASN 0.*
